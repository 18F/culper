    '# Purpose of this form',
    'This form will be used by the United States (U.S.) Government in conducting background investigations, reinvestigations, and continuous evaluations of persons under consideration for, or retention of, national security positions as defined in 5 CFR 732, and for individuals requiring eligibility for access to classified information under Executive Order 12968. This form may also be used by agencies in determining whether a subject performing work for, or on behalf of, the Government under a contract should be deemed eligible for logical or physical access when the nature of the work to be performed is sensitive and could bring about an adverse effect on the national security.',
    'Providing this information is voluntary. If you do not provide each item of requested information, however, we will not be able to complete your investigation, which will adversely affect your eligibility for a national security position, eligibility for access to classified information, or logical or physical access. It is imperative that the information provided be true and accurate, to the best of your knowledge. Any information that you provide is evaluated on the basis of its currency, seriousness, relevance to the position and duties, and consistency with all other information about you. Withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information may affect your eligibility for access to classified information, eligibility for a sensitive position, or your ability to obtain or retain Federal or contract employment. In addition, withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information may affect your eligibility for physical and logical access to federally controlled facilities or information systems. Withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information may also negatively affect your employment prospects and job status, and the potential consequences include, but are not limited to, removal, debarment from Federal service, loss of eligibility for access to classified information, or prosecution.',
    'This form may become a permanent document that may be used as the basis for future investigations, eligibility determinations for access to classified information, or to hold a sensitive position, suitability or fitness for Federal employment, fitness for contract employment, or eligibility for physical and logical access to federally controlled facilities or information systems. Your responses to this form may be compared with your responses to previous SF-86 questionnaires.',
    'The investigation conducted on the basis of information provided on this form may be selected for studies and analyses in support of evaluating and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the investigative and adjudicative methodologies. All study results released to the general public will delete personal identifiers such as name, Social Security Number, and date and place of birth.',
    '---',
    '# Authority to request this information',
    'Depending upon the purpose of your investigation, the U.S. Government is authorized to ask for this information under Executive Orders 10450, 10865, 12333, and 12968; sections 3301, 3302, and 9101 of title 5, United States Code (U.S.C.); sections 2165 and 2201 of title 42, U.S.C.; chapter 23 of title 50, U.S.C.; and parts 2, 5, 731, 732, and 736 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).',
    'Your Social Security Number (SSN) is needed to identify records unique to you. Although disclosure of your SSN is not mandatory, failure to disclose your SSN may prevent or delay the processing of your background investigation. The authority for soliciting and verifying your SSN is Executive Order 9397, as amended by EO 13478.',
    '---',
    '# The investigative process',
    'Background investigations for national security positions are conducted to gather information to determine whether you are reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and loyal to the U.S. The information that you provide on this form may be confirmed during the investigation. The investigation may extend beyond the time covered by this form, when necessary to resolve issues. Your current employer may be contacted as part of the investigation, although you may have previously indicated on applications or other forms that you do not want your current employer to be contacted. If you have a security freeze on your consumer or credit report file, then we may not be able to complete your investigation, which can adversely affect your eligibility for a national security position. To avoid such delays, you should request that the consumer reporting agencies lift the freeze in these instances.',
    'In addition to the questions on this form, inquiry also is made about your adherence to security requirements, your honesty and integrity, vulnerability to exploitation or coercion, falsification, misrepresentation, and any other behavior, activities, or associations that tend to demonstrate a person is not reliable, trustworthy, or loyal. Federal agency records checks may be conducted on your spouse or legally recognized civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant(s), and immediate family members. After an eligibility determination has been completed, you also may be subject to continuous evaluation, which may include periodic reinvestigations, to determine whether retention in your position is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.',
    'The information you provide on this form may be confirmed during the investigation, and may be used for identification purposes throughout the investigation process.',
    '---',
    '# Your personal interview',
    'Some investigations will include an interview with you as a routine part of the investigative process. The investigator may ask you to explain your answers to any question on this form. This provides you the opportunity to update, clarify, and explain information on your form more completely, which often assists in completing your investigation. It is imperative that the interview be conducted as soon as possible after you are contacted. Postponements will delay the processing of your investigation, and declining to be interviewed may result in your investigation being delayed or canceled.',
    'For the interview, you will be required to provide photo identification, such as a valid state driver\'s license. You may be required to provide other documents to verify your identity, as instructed by your investigator. These documents may include certification of any legal name change, Social Security card, passport, and/or your birth certificate. You may also be asked to provide documents regarding information that you provide on this form, or about other matters requiring specific attention. These matters include (a) alien registration or naturalization documentation; (b) delinquent loans or taxes, bankruptcies, judgments, liens, or other financial obligations; (c) agreements involving child custody or support, alimony, or property settlements; (d) arrests, convictions, probation, and/or parole; or (e) other matters described in court records.',
    '---',
    '# Final determination on your eligibility',
    'Final determination on your eligibility for a national security position is the responsibility of the Federal agency that requested your investigation and the agency that conducted your investigation. You will be provided the opportunity to explain, refute, or clarify any information before a final decision is made, if an unfavorable decision is considered. The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of prohibited categories, including but not limited to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, disability, or sexual orientation when granting access to classified information.',
    '---',
    '# Penalties for inaccurate or false statements',
    'The U.S. Criminal Code (title 18, section 1001) provides that knowingly falsifying or concealing a material fact is a felony which may result in fines and/or up to five (5) years imprisonment. In addition, Federal agencies generally fire, do not grant a security clearance, or disqualify individuals who have materially and deliberately falsified these forms, and this remains a part of the permanent record for future placements. Your prospects of placement or security clearance are better if you answer all questions truthfully and completely. You will have adequate opportunity to explain any information you provide on this form and to make your comments part of the record.',
    '---',
    '# Disclosure information',
    'The information you provide is for the purpose of investigating you for a national security position, and the information will be protected from unauthorized disclosure. The collection, maintenance, and disclosure of background investigative information are governed by the Privacy Act. The agency that requested the investigation and the agency that conducted the investigation have published notices in the Federal Register describing the systems of records in which your records will be maintained.
