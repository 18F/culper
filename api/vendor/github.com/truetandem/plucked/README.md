# plucked

`plucked` is a fork of [`goose`](https://bitbucket.org/liamstask/goose) which is a database
migration tool.

This fork was created for the purpose of:

 - [x] a focus on PostgresSQL
 - [x] removal of code or dependencies reliant on CGO

You can manage your database's evolution by creating incremental SQL or Go scripts.

# Installation

``` shell
$ go get -u github.com/truetandem/plucked
```

This will install the `plucked` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. You may also build
`plucked` into your own applications by importing `github.com/truetandem/plucked/migration`.
Documentation is available at [godoc.org](https://godoc.org/github.com/truetandem/plucked/migration).
