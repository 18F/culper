            "value": "\"It has long been a grave question whether any government not too\nstrong for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to\nmaintain its existence in great emergencies. On this point, the\npresent rebellion brought our republic to a severe test, and the\nPresidential election, occurring in regular course during the\nrebellion, added not a little to the strain.... The strife of\nthe election is but human nature practically applied to the facts\nin the case. What has occurred in this case must ever occur in\nsimilar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future\ngreat national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as\ngood. Let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy\nto learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged....\nNow that the election is over, may not all having a common\ninterest reunite in a common fort to save our common country?\nFor my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing\nany obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am deeply\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election and duly\ngrateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good,\nit adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be\ndisappointed or pained by the result.\"\n\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is\nin a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great\nstatesman who made it, alike in its strong common-sense and in\nits lofty standard of morality. Lincoln's life, Lincoln's deeds\nand words, are not only of consuming interest to the historian,\nbut should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard\npractical work of American political life. It is difficult to\noverstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two\nforemost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to\nfeel that the highest ambition any American can possibly have\nwill be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward\nthe standards set by these two men.\n\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to\nadvance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse\nfor doing poorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to\nstudy the history of the great deeds of the past, and of the\ngreat men who did them, with an earnest desire to profit thereby\nso as to render better service in the present. In their\nessentials, the men of the present day are much like the men of\nthe past, and the live issues of the present can be faced to\nbetter advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a\nstudy of Lincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of\nimmorality and inefficiency--the gulfs which always lie one on\neach side of the careers alike of man and of nation. It helps\nnothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the\nother. The fanatic, the well-meaning moralist of unbalanced\nmind, the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power\nhimself to do good and but little power to do ill--all these were\nas alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves.\nHis life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury\nwithout substance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or\nelse what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the\nmost destructive kind of folly.\n\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to\nleadership in his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the\nsense of fealty to a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life,\nhe also accepted human nature as it is, and worked with keen,\npractical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at\nhand. It is impossible to conceive of "

We are\nalways inclined to idealize that which we love,--a state of mind\nvery unfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment. It\nis therefore not surprising that most of those who have written\nor spoken on that extraordinary man, even while conscientiously\nendeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being, and to\nform a just estimate of his public conduct, should have drifted\ninto more or less indiscriminating eulogy, painting his great\nfeatures in the most glowing colors, and covering with tender\nshadings whatever might look like a blemish.\n\nBut his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere\npraise of his virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of\nhis limitations and faults. The stature of the great man, one of\nwhose peculiar charms consisted in his being so unlike all other\ngreat men, will rather lose than gain by the idealization which\nso easily runs into the commonplace. For it was distinctly the\nweird mixture of qualities and forces in him, of the lofty with\nthe common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which he had\nbecome with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him so\nfascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his\nsingular power over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be\nthe greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\n\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the\nmilitary hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure\nin American history; but we may search in vain among our\ncelebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled Abraham\nLincoln's in wretchedness.

When a\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his\nfather's clearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or\ndig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also\nto \"tend the baby,\" when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged.\nHe could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of\nactivity when he obtained work in a \"crossroads store,\" where he\namused the customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon\ndistinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had\nsomething to say worth listening to.

He first saw the light in a miserable\nhovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in\na dreary neighborhood; his father a typical \"poor Southern\nwhite,\" shiftless and without ambition for himself or his\nchildren, constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he\nmight make a living without much work; his mother, in her youth\nhandsome and bright, grown prematurely coarse in feature and\nsoured in mind by daily toil and care; the whole household\nsqualid, cheerless, and utterly void of elevating inspirations...\nOnly when the family had \"moved\" into the malarious backwoods of\nIndiana, the mother had died, and a stepmother, a woman of thrift\nand energy, had taken charge of the children, the shaggy-headed,\nragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old, \"began to\nfeel like a human being.\" Hard work was his early lot. When a\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his\nfather's clearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or\ndig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also\nto \"tend the baby,\" when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged.\nHe could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of\nactivity when he obtained work in a \"crossroads store,\" where he\namused the customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon\ndistinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had\nsomething to say worth listening to. To win that distinction, he\nhad to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst for\nknowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\nwere wofully slender.\n\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was\ntaught only reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among\nthe people of the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen,\nhe found none of uncommon intelligence or education; but some of\nthem had a few books, which he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read\nand reread, AEsop's Fables, learning to tell stories with a point\nand to argue by parables; he read Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's\nProgress, a short history of the United States, and Weems's Life\nof Washington. To the town constable's he went to read the\nRevised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page that fell into\nhis hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends\nwatched "

                      "value": "\"It has long been a grave question whether any government not too\nstrong for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to\nmaintain its existence in great emergencies. On this point, the\npresent rebellion brought our republic to a severe test, and the\nPresidential election, occurring in regular course during the\nrebellion, added not a little to the strain.... The strife of\nthe election is but human nature practically applied to the facts\nin the case. What has occurred in this case must ever occur in\nsimilar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future\ngreat national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as\ngood. Let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy\nto learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged....\nNow that the election is over, may not all having a common\ninterest reunite in a common fort to save our common country?\nFor my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing\nany obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am deeply\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election and duly\ngrateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good,\nit adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be\ndisappointed or pained by the result.\"\n\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is\nin a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great\nstatesman who made it, alike in its strong common-sense and in\nits lofty standard of morality. Lincoln's life, Lincoln's deeds\nand words, are not only of consuming interest to the historian,\nbut should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard\npractical work of American political life. It is difficult to\noverstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two\nforemost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to\nfeel that the highest ambition any American can possibly have\nwill be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward\nthe standards set by these two men.\n\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to\nadvance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse\nfor doing poorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to\nstudy the history of the great deeds of the past, and of the\ngreat men who did them, with an earnest desire to profit thereby\nso as to render better service in the present. In their\nessentials, the men of the present day are much like the men of\nthe past, and the live issues of the present can be faced to\nbetter advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a\nstudy of Lincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of\nimmorality and inefficiency--the gulfs which always lie one on\neach side of the careers alike of man and of nation. It helps\nnothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the\nother. The fanatic, the well-meaning moralist of unbalanced\nmind, the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power\nhimself to do good and but little power to do ill--all these were\nas alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves.\nHis life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury\nwithout substance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or\nelse what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the\nmost destructive kind of folly.\n\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to\nleadership in his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the\nsense of fealty to a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life,\nhe also accepted human nature as it is, and worked with keen,\npractical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at\nhand. It is impossible to conceive of "

When a\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his\nfather's clearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or\ndig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also\nto \"tend the baby,\" when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged.\nHe could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of\nactivity when he obtained work in a \"crossroads store,\" where he\namused the customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon\ndistinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had\nsomething to say worth listening to. To win that distinction, he\nhad to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst for\nknowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\nwere wofully slender.\n\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was\ntaught only reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among\nthe people of the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen,\nhe found none of uncommon intelligence or education; but some of\nthem had a few books, which he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read\nand reread, AEsop's Fables, learning to tell stories with a point\nand to argue by parables; he read Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's\nProgress, a short history of the United States, and Weems's Life\nof Washington.

It\nis therefore not surprising that most of those who have written\nor spoken on that extraordinary man, even while conscientiously\nendeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being, and to\nform a just estimate of his public conduct, should have drifted\ninto more or less indiscriminating eulogy, painting his great\nfeatures in the most glowing colors, and covering with tender\nshadings whatever might look like a blemish.\n\nBut his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere\npraise of his virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of\nhis limitations and faults. The stature of the great man, one of\nwhose peculiar charms consisted in his being so unlike all other\ngreat men, will rather lose than gain by the idealization which\nso easily runs into the commonplace. For it was distinctly the\nweird mixture of qualities and forces in him, of the lofty with\nthe common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which he had\nbecome with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him so\nfascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his\nsingular power over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be\nthe greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\n\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the\nmilitary hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure\nin American history; but we may search in vain among our\ncelebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled Abraham\nLincoln's in wretchedness. He first saw the light in a miserable\nhovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in\na dreary neighborhood; his father a typical \"poor Southern\nwhite,\" shiftless and without ambition for himself or his\nchildren, constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he\nmight make a living without much work; his mother, in her youth\nhandsome and bright, grown prematurely coarse in feature and\nsoured in mind by daily toil and care; the whole household\nsqualid, cheerless, and utterly void of elevating inspirations...\nOnly when the family had \"moved\" into the malarious backwoods of\nIndiana, the mother had died, and a stepmother, a woman of thrift\nand energy, had taken charge of the children, the shaggy-headed,\nragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old, \"began to\nfeel like a human being.\" Hard work was his early lot. When a\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his\nfather's clearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or\ndig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also\nto \"tend the baby,\" when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged.\nHe could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of\nactivity when he obtained work in a \"crossroads store,\" where he\namused the customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon\ndistinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had\nsomething to say worth listening to. To win that distinction, he\nhad to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst for\nknowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\nwere wofully slender.\n\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was\ntaught only reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among\nthe people of the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen,\nhe found none of uncommon intelligence or education; but some of\nthem had a few books, which he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read\nand reread, AEsop's Fables, learning to tell stories with a point\nand to argue by parables; he read Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's\nProgress, a short history of the United States, and Weems's Life\nof Washington.

He got a good estate by merchandise, \nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he \nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very \ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson \nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we \nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; \nand so my companions always called me.\n\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an \nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the \nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk \nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never \nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\n\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my \nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My \nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of \nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school \ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied \nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so \nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and \nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other \nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity \nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to \nbefall me.\n\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent \ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one \nmorning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and \nexpostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me \nwhat reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for \nleaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well \nintroduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application \nand industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was \nmen of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior \nfortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by \nenterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature \nout of the common road; that these things were all either too far \nabove me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or \nwhat might be called the upper station of low life, which he had \nfound, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the \nmost suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and \nhardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of \nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and \nenvy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the \nhappiness of this state by this one thing - viz. that this was the \nstate of life which all other people envied; that kings have \nfrequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to \ngreat things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the \ntwo extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man \ngave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he \nprayed to have neither poverty nor riches.\n\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities \nof life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but \nthat the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not \nexposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of \nmankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and \nuneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious \nliving, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard \nlabour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the \nother hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural \nconsequences of their way of living; that the middle station of \nlife was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of \nenjoyments;"

He told me I might judge of the \nhappiness of this state by this one thing - viz. that this was the \nstate of life which all other people envied; that kings have \nfrequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to \ngreat things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the \ntwo extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man \ngave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he \nprayed to have neither poverty nor riches.\n\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities \nof life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but \nthat the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not \nexposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of \nmankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and \nuneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious \nliving, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard \nlabour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the \nother hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural \nconsequences of their way of living; that the middle station of \nlife was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of \nenjoyments;"

For it was distinctly the\nweird mixture of qualities and forces in him, of the lofty with\nthe common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which he had\nbecome with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him so\nfascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his\nsingular power over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be\nthe greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\n\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the\nmilitary hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure\nin American history; but we may search in vain among our\ncelebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled Abraham\nLincoln's in wretchedness. He first saw the light in a miserable\nhovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in\na dreary neighborhood; his father a typical \"poor Southern\nwhite,\" shiftless and without ambition for himself or his\nchildren, constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he\nmight make a living without much work; his mother, in her youth\nhandsome and bright, grown prematurely coarse in feature and\nsoured in mind by daily toil and care; the whole household\nsqualid, cheerless, and utterly void of elevating inspirations...\nOnly when the family had \"moved\" into the malarious backwoods of\nIndiana, the mother had died, and a stepmother, a woman of thrift\nand energy, had taken charge of the children, the shaggy-headed,\nragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old, \"began to\nfeel like a human being.\" Hard work was his early lot. When a\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his\nfather's clearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or\ndig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also\nto \"tend the baby,\" when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged.\nHe could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of\nactivity when he obtained work in a \"crossroads store,\" where he\namused the customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon\ndistinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had\nsomething to say worth listening to. To win that distinction, he\nhad to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst for\nknowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\nwere wofully slender.\n\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was\ntaught only reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among\nthe people of the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen,\nhe found none of uncommon intelligence or education; but some of\nthem had a few books, which he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read\nand reread, AEsop's Fables, learning to tell stories with a point\nand to argue by parables; he read Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's\nProgress, a short history of the United States, and Weems's Life\nof Washington. To the town constable's he went to read the\nRevised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page that fell into\nhis hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends\nwatched h"

We are\nalways inclined to idealize that which we love,--a state of mind\nvery unfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment. It\nis therefore not surprising that most of those who have written\nor spoken on that extraordinary man, even while conscientiously\nendeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being, and to\nform a just estimate of his public conduct, should have drifted\ninto more or less indiscriminating eulogy, painting his great\nfeatures in the most glowing colors, and covering with tender\nshadings whatever might look like a blemish.\n\nBut his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere\npraise of his virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of\nhis limitations and faults. The stature of the great man, one of\nwhose peculiar charms consisted in his being so unlike all other\ngreat men, will rather lose than gain by the idealization which\nso easily runs into the commonplace. For it was distinctly the\nweird mixture of qualities and forces in him, of the lofty with\nthe common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which he had\nbecome with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him so\nfascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his\nsingular power over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be\nthe greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\n\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the\nmilitary hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure\nin American history; but we may search in vain among our\ncelebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled Abraham\nLincoln's in wretchedness.

                          "value": "No American can study the character and career of Abraham Lincoln\nwithout being carried away by sentimental emotions. We are\nalways inclined to idealize that which we love,--a state of mind\nvery unfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment. It\nis therefore not surprising that most of those who have written\nor spoken on that extraordinary man, even while conscientiously\nendeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being, and to\nform a just estimate of his public conduct, should have drifted\ninto more or less indiscriminating eulogy, painting his great\nfeatures in the most glowing colors, and covering with tender\nshadings whatever might look like a blemish.\n\nBut his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere\npraise of his virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of\nhis limitations and faults. The stature of the great man, one of\nwhose peculiar charms consisted in his being so unlike all other\ngreat men, will rather lose than gain by the idealization which\nso easily runs into the commonplace. For it was distinctly the\nweird mixture of qualities and forces in him, of the lofty with\nthe common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which he had\nbecome with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him so\nfascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his\nsingular power over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be\nthe greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\n\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the\nmilitary hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure\nin American history; but we may search in vain among our\ncelebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled Abraham\nLincoln's in wretchedness. He first saw the light in a miserable\nhovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in\na dreary neighborhood; his father a typical \"poor Southern\nwhite,\" shiftless and without ambition for himself or his\nchildren, constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he\nmight make a living without much work; his mother, in her youth\nhandsome and bright, grown prematurely coarse in feature and\nsoured in mind by daily toil and care; the whole household\nsqualid, cheerless, and utterly void of elevating inspirations...\nOnly when the family had \"moved\" into the malarious backwoods of\nIndiana, the mother had died, and a stepmother, a woman of thrift\nand energy, had taken charge of the children, the shaggy-headed,\nragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old, \"began to\nfeel like a human being.\" Hard work was his early lot. When a\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his\nfather's clearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or\ndig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also\nto \"tend the baby,\" when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged.\nHe could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of\nactivity when he obtained work in a \"crossroads store,\" where he\namused the customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon\ndistinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had\nsomething to say worth listening to. To win that distinction, he\nhad to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst for\nknowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\nwere wofully slender.\n\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was\ntaught only reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among\nthe people of the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen,\nhe found none of uncommon intelligence or education; but some of\nthem had a few books, which he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read\nand reread, AEsop's Fables, learning to tell stories with a point\nand to argue by parables; he read Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's\nProgress, a short history of the United States, and Weems's Life\nof Washington. To the town constable's he went to read the\nRevised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page that fell into\nhis hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends\nwatched h"

While I am deeply\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election and duly\ngrateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good,\nit adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be\ndisappointed or pained by the result.\"\n\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is\nin a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great\nstatesman who made it, alike in its strong common-sense and in\nits lofty standard of morality. Lincoln's life, Lincoln's deeds\nand words, are not only of consuming interest to the historian,\nbut should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard\npractical work of American political life. It is difficult to\noverstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two\nforemost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to\nfeel that the highest ambition any American can possibly have\nwill be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward\nthe standards set by these two men.\n\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to\nadvance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse\nfor doing poorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to\nstudy the history of the great deeds of the past, and of the\ngreat men who did them, with an earnest desire to profit thereby\nso as to render better service in the present. In their\nessentials, the men of the present day are much like the men of\nthe past, and the live issues of the present can be faced to\nbetter advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a\nstudy of Lincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of\nimmorality and inefficiency--the gulfs which always lie one on\neach side of the careers alike of man and of nation. It helps\nnothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the\nother. The fanatic, the well-meaning moralist of unbalanced\nmind, the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power\nhimself to do good and but little power to do ill--all these were\nas alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves.\nHis life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury\nwithout substance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or\nelse what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the\nmost destructive kind of folly.\n\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to\nleadership in his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the\nsense of fealty to a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life,\nhe also accepted human nature as it is, and worked with keen,\npractical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at\nhand. It is impossible to conceive of "

On this point, the\npresent rebellion brought our republic to a severe test, and the\nPresidential election, occurring in regular course during the\nrebellion, added not a little to the strain.... The strife of\nthe election is but human nature practically applied to the facts\nin the case. What has occurred in this case must ever occur in\nsimilar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future\ngreat national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as\ngood. Let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy\nto learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged....\nNow that the election is over, may not all having a common\ninterest reunite in a common fort to save our common country?\nFor my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing\nany obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am deeply\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election and duly\ngrateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good,\nit adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be\ndisappointed or pained by the result.\"\n\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is\nin a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great\nstatesman who made it, alike in its strong common-sense and in\nits lofty standard of morality. Lincoln's life, Lincoln's deeds\nand words, are not only of consuming interest to the historian,\nbut should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard\npractical work of American political life. It is difficult to\noverstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two\nforemost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to\nfeel that the highest ambition any American can possibly have\nwill be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward\nthe standards set by these two men.\n\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to\nadvance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse\nfor doing poorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to\nstudy the history of the great deeds of the past, and of the\ngreat men who did them, with an earnest desire to profit thereby\nso as to render better service in the present. In their\nessentials, the men of the present day are much like the men of\nthe past, and the live issues of the present can be faced to\nbetter advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a\nstudy of Lincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of\nimmorality and inefficiency--the gulfs which always lie one on\neach side of the careers alike of man and of nation. It helps\nnothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the\nother. The fanatic, the well-meaning moralist of unbalanced\nmind, the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power\nhimself to do good and but little power to do ill--all these were\nas alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves.\nHis life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury\nwithout substance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or\nelse what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the\nmost destructive kind of folly.\n\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to\nleadership in his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the\nsense of fealty to a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life,\nhe also accepted human nature as it is, and worked with keen,\npractical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at\nhand. It is impossible to conceive of "

On this point, the\npresent rebellion brought our republic to a severe test, and the\nPresidential election, occurring in regular course during the\nrebellion, added not a little to the strain.... The strife of\nthe election is but human nature practically applied to the facts\nin the case. What has occurred in this case must ever occur in\nsimilar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future\ngreat national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as\ngood. Let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy\nto learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged....\nNow that the election is over, may not all having a common\ninterest reunite in a common fort to save our common country?\nFor my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing\nany obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am deeply\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election and duly\ngrateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good,\nit adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be\ndisappointed or pained by the result.\"\n\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is\nin a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great\nstatesman who made it, alike in its strong common-sense and in\nits lofty standard of morality. Lincoln's life, Lincoln's deeds\nand words, are not only of consuming interest to the historian,\nbut should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard\npractical work of American political life. It is difficult to\noverstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two\nforemost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to\nfeel that the highest ambition any American can possibly have\nwill be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward\nthe standards set by these two men.\n\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to\nadvance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse\nfor doing poorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to\nstudy the history of the great deeds of the past, and of the\ngreat men who did them, with an earnest desire to profit thereby\nso as to render better service in the present. In their\nessentials, the men of the present day are much like the men of\nthe past, and the live issues of the present can be faced to\nbetter advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a\nstudy of Lincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of\nimmorality and inefficiency--the gulfs which always lie one on\neach side of the careers alike of man and of nation. It helps\nnothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the\nother. The fanatic, the well-meaning moralist of unbalanced\nmind, the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power\nhimself to do good and but little power to do ill--all these were\nas alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves.\nHis life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury\nwithout substance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or\nelse what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the\nmost destructive kind of folly.\n\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to\nleadership in his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the\nsense of fealty to a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life,\nhe also accepted human nature as it is, and worked with keen,\npractical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at\nhand. It is impossible to conceive of "

He got a good estate by merchandise, \nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he \nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very \ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson \nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we \nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; \nand so my companions always called me.\n\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an \nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the \nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk \nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never \nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\n\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my \nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My \nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of \nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school \ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied \nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so \nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and \nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other \nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity \nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to \nbefall me.\n\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent \ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design.

He got a good estate by merchandise, \nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he \nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very \ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson \nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we \nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; \nand so my companions always called me.\n\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an \nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the \nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk \nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never \nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\n\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my \nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My \nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of \nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school \ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied \nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so \nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and \nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other \nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity \nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to \nbefall me.\n\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent \ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one \nmorning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and \nexpostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me \nwhat reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for \nleaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well \nintroduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application \nand industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was \nmen of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior \nfortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by \nenterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature \nout of the common road; that these things were all either too far \nabove me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or \nwhat might be called the upper station of low life, which he had \nfound, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the \nmost suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and \nhardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of \nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and \nenvy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the \nhappiness of this state by this one thing - viz. that this was the \nstate of life which all other people envied; that kings have \nfrequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to \ngreat things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the \ntwo extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man \ngave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he \nprayed to have neither poverty nor riches.\n\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities \nof life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but \nthat the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not \nexposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of \nmankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and \nuneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious \nliving, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard \nlabour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the \nother hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural \nconsequences of their way of living; that the middle station of \nlife was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of \nenjoyments;"

                                "value": "I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, \nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, \nwho settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, \nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he \nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very \ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson \nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we \nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; \nand so my companions always called me.\n\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an \nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the \nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk \nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never \nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\n\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my \nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My \nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of \nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school \ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied \nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so \nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and \nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other \nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity \nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to \nbefall me.\n\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent \ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one \nmorning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and \nexpostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me \nwhat reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for \nleaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well \nintroduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application \nand industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was \nmen of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior \nfortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by \nenterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature \nout of the common road; that these things were all either too far \nabove me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or \nwhat might be called the upper station of low life, which he had \nfound, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the \nmost suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and \nhardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of \nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and \nenvy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the \nhappiness of this state by this one thing - viz. that this was the \nstate of life which all other people envied; that kings have \nfrequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to \ngreat things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the \ntwo extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man \ngave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he \nprayed to have neither poverty nor riches.\n\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities \nof life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but \nthat the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not \nexposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of \nmankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and \nuneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious \nliving, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard \nlabour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the \nother hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural \nconsequences of their way of living; that the middle station of \nlife was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of \nenjoyments;"

In their\nessentials, the men of the present day are much like the men of\nthe past, and the live issues of the present can be faced to\nbetter advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past.

He got a good estate by merchandise, \nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he \nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very \ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson \nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we \nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; \nand so my companions always called me.\n\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an \nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the \nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk \nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never \nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\n\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my \nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My \nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of \nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school \ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied \nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so \nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and \nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other \nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity \nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to \nbefall me.\n\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent \ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one \nmorning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and \nexpostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me \nwhat reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for \nleaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well \nintroduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application \nand industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was \nmen of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior \nfortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by \nenterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature \nout of the common road; that these things were all either too far \nabove me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or \nwhat might be called the upper station of low life, which he had \nfound, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the \nmost suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and \nhardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of \nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and \nenvy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the \nhappiness of this state by this one thing - viz. that this was the \nstate of life which all other people envied; that kings have \nfrequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to \ngreat things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the \ntwo extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man \ngave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he \nprayed to have neither poverty nor riches.\n\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities \nof life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but \nthat the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not \nexposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of \nmankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and \nuneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious \nliving, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard \nlabour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the \nother hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural \nconsequences of their way of living; that the middle station of \nlife was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of \nenjoyments;"

On this point, the\npresent rebellion brought our republic to a severe test, and the\nPresidential election, occurring in regular course during the\nrebellion, added not a little to the strain.... The strife of\nthe election is but human nature practically applied to the facts\nin the case. What has occurred in this case must ever occur in\nsimilar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future\ngreat national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as\ngood. Let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy\nto learn wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged....\nNow that the election is over, may not all having a common\ninterest reunite in a common fort to save our common country?\nFor my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing\nany obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am deeply\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election and duly\ngrateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my\ncountrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good,\nit adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be\ndisappointed or pained by the result.\"\n\nThis speech has not attracted much general attention, yet it is\nin a peculiar degree both illustrative and typical of the great\nstatesman who made it, alike in its strong common-sense and in\nits lofty standard of morality. Lincoln's life, Lincoln's deeds\nand words, are not only of consuming interest to the historian,\nbut should be intimately known to every man engaged in the hard\npractical work of American political life. It is difficult to\noverstate how much it means to a nation to have as the two\nforemost figures in its history men like Washington and Lincoln.\nIt is good for every man in any way concerned in public life to\nfeel that the highest ambition any American can possibly have\nwill be gratified just in proportion as he raises himself toward\nthe standards set by these two men.\n\nIt is a very poor thing, whether for nations or individuals, to\nadvance the history of great deeds done in the past as an excuse\nfor doing poorly in the present; but it is an excellent thing to\nstudy the history of the great deeds of the past, and of the\ngreat men who did them, with an earnest desire to profit thereby\nso as to render better service in the present. In their\nessentials, the men of the present day are much like the men of\nthe past, and the live issues of the present can be faced to\nbetter advantage by men who have in good faith studied how the\nleaders of the nation faced the dead issues of the past. Such a\nstudy of Lincoln's life will enable us to avoid the twin gulfs of\nimmorality and inefficiency--the gulfs which always lie one on\neach side of the careers alike of man and of nation. It helps\nnothing to have avoided one if shipwreck is encountered in the\nother. The fanatic, the well-meaning moralist of unbalanced\nmind, the parlor critic who condemns others but has no power\nhimself to do good and but little power to do ill--all these were\nas alien to Lincoln as the vicious and unpatriotic themselves.\nHis life teaches our people that they must act with wisdom,\nbecause otherwise adherence to right will be mere sound and fury\nwithout substance; and that they must also act high-mindedly, or\nelse what seems to be wisdom will in the end turn out to be the\nmost destructive kind of folly.\n\nThroughout his entire life, and especially after he rose to\nleadership in his party, Lincoln was stirred to his depths by the\nsense of fealty to a lofty ideal; but throughout his entire life,\nhe also accepted human nature as it is, and worked with keen,\npractical good sense to achieve results with the instruments at\nhand.

He got a good estate by merchandise, \nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he \nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very \ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson \nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we \nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; \nand so my companions always called me.\n\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an \nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the \nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk \nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never \nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\n\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my \nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My \nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of \nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school \ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied \nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so \nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and \nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other \nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity \nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to \nbefall me.\n\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent \ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design.

He told me it was \nmen of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior \nfortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by \nenterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature \nout of the common road; that these things were all either too far \nabove me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or \nwhat might be called the upper station of low life, which he had \nfound, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the \nmost suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and \nhardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of \nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and \nenvy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the \nhappiness of this state by this one thing - viz. that this was the \nstate of life which all other people envied; that kings have \nfrequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to \ngreat things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the \ntwo extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man \ngave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he \nprayed to have neither poverty nor riches.\n\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities \nof life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but \nthat the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not \nexposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of \nmankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and \nuneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious \nliving, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard \nlabour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the \nother hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural \nconsequences of their way of living; that the middle station of \nlife was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of \nenjoyments;"

He got a good estate by merchandise, \nand leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he \nhad married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very \ngood family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson \nKreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we \nare now called - nay we call ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; \nand so my companions always called me.\n\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an \nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the \nfamous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk \nagainst the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never \nknew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.\n\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my \nhead began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My \nfather, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of \nlearning, as far as house-education and a country free school \ngenerally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied \nwith nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so \nstrongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and \nagainst all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other \nfriends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity \nof nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to \nbefall me.\n\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent \ncounsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one \nmorning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and \nexpostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me \nwhat reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for \nleaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well \nintroduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application \nand industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.

The strife of\nthe election is but human nature practically applied to the facts\nin the case. What has occurred in this case must ever occur in\nsimilar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future\ngreat national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall\nhave as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as\ngood.

We are\nalways inclined to idealize that which we love,--a state of mind\nvery unfavorable to the exercise of sober critical judgment. It\nis therefore not surprising that most of those who have written\nor spoken on that extraordinary man, even while conscientiously\nendeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being, and to\nform a just estimate of his public conduct, should have drifted\ninto more or less indiscriminating eulogy, painting his great\nfeatures in the most glowing colors, and covering with tender\nshadings whatever might look like a blemish.\n\nBut his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere\npraise of his virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of\nhis limitations and faults. The stature of the great man, one of\nwhose peculiar charms consisted in his being so unlike all other\ngreat men, will rather lose than gain by the idealization which\nso easily runs into the commonplace. For it was distinctly the\nweird mixture of qualities and forces in him, of the lofty with\nthe common, the ideal with the uncouth, of that which he had\nbecome with that which he had not ceased to be, that made him so\nfascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his\nsingular power over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be\nthe greatest leader in the greatest crisis of our national life.\n\nHis was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the\nmilitary hero born and reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure\nin American history; but we may search in vain among our\ncelebrities for one whose origin and early life equalled Abraham\nLincoln's in wretchedness. He first saw the light in a miserable\nhovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in\na dreary neighborhood; his father a typical \"poor Southern\nwhite,\" shiftless and without ambition for himself or his\nchildren, constantly looking for a new piece of land on which he\nmight make a living without much work; his mother, in her youth\nhandsome and bright, grown prematurely coarse in feature and\nsoured in mind by daily toil and care; the whole household\nsqualid, cheerless, and utterly void of elevating inspirations...\nOnly when the family had \"moved\" into the malarious backwoods of\nIndiana, the mother had died, and a stepmother, a woman of thrift\nand energy, had taken charge of the children, the shaggy-headed,\nragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old, \"began to\nfeel like a human being.\" Hard work was his early lot. When a\nmere boy he had to help in supporting the family, either on his\nfather's clearing, or hired out to other farmers to plough, or\ndig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox teams; occasionally also\nto \"tend the baby,\" when the farmer's wife was otherwise engaged.\nHe could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of\nactivity when he obtained work in a \"crossroads store,\" where he\namused the customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon\ndistinguished himself among the backwoods folk as one who had\nsomething to say worth listening to. To win that distinction, he\nhad to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst for\nknowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst\nwere wofully slender.\n\nIn the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was\ntaught only reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among\nthe people of the settlement, bush farmers and small tradesmen,\nhe found none of uncommon intelligence or education; but some of\nthem had a few books, which he borrowed eagerly. Thus he read\nand reread, AEsop's Fables, learning to tell stories with a point\nand to argue by parables; he read Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's\nProgress, a short history of the United States, and Weems's Life\nof Washington. To the town constable's he went to read the\nRevised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page that fell into\nhis hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends\nwatched h"
