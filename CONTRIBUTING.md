## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! If you're unsure about anything,
just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to
change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the
[18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors
should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its
[README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the
[18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository](https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just
[shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

## Where to contribute?

During the development process the development fork of the project will be hosted at [18F/e-QIP-prototype](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype).
This may cause some confusion so we have outlined some basic steps for contributing:

 1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype $GOPATH/src/18F/e-QIP-prototype`
 2. Change in to the new directory `cd $GOPATH/src/18F/e-QIP-prototype`
 3. Fork the code on Github
 4. Add a **git remote** with `git remote add fork <path/to/forked/repository>`
 5. Make changes and commit them locally
 6. Push to **fork** using `git push fork`
 7. Create a **pull request** from the forked repository to the [18F/e-QIP-prototype](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype) repository
