To create the e-QIP questionnaire prototype, the project team is employing a user-centered design approach leveraging key principles from the
[U.S. Digital Services Playbook][8]:

1. Understand what people need
2. Address the whole experience, from start to finish
3. Make it simple and intuitive

## Project Management

The project team utilizes [GitHub Projects][9] as an in integrated project management tool to administer User Stories, Tasks, and Sprints.

 - [Board/Backlog][10]
 - [Milestones/Sprints][11]
 - [Epics/User Stories][12]

GitHub commits can be traced back to their corresponding tasks through commit comments.  Commits directly related to a task will be prefixed with the task ID:

```
truetandem/e-QIP-prototype#issue_number Commit description
```

[Keywords][13] can be used to change the status of the associated issue

## Getting to know the code

### Clone all things

Clone the repository and `cd` into it:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/18F
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/18F
git clone https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype
cd e-QIP-prototype
```

Then to develop locally, create a `.env` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

### Docker/docker-compose setup

Once `cd`'d into the cloned repository (and having created a `.env` file):

```
$ docker-compose up
```

### Checking dependencies

For quick development we use [yarn][19] but you may use [npm][16] as well. Once
this has been installed we execute a single command:

```
yarn install
```

For dependencies on the backend use [glide][17]:

```
glide install
```

### Building the application

Compiling all of the assets can be done simply using the command:

```
yarn build
```

This will compile JavaScript, SASS, and place all files where they need to be. Both versions of JavaScript files (minified and not) are preserved.

### Running a local server

To run a local server we are using [docker][21] containers leveraging the [docker-compose][20] tool:

```
docker-compose up
```

Then direct your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The access the site in development use the username `test01` and password `password01`.

### Executing tests and coverage reports

To make a single pass through the test suite use the command:

```
yarn test
```

The individual test results will be seen in the output, and the coverage
results may be viewed after running ```yarn test```.

### Packaging Application

To package up the application, use the command:

```
yarn build
```

This will generate the following file structure:

```
dist/
   css/
   fonts/
   img/
   eqip.min.js
   index.html
```

where
 - `css/` contains the production ready stylesheets
 - `fonts/` contains the fonts used in the application
 - `img/` contains the images used in the application

### Tooling

#### Linters

For Ninjas (Vim) just install ```syntastic``` and everything should be handled.
For Pirates (Emacs) just install ```flycheck``` and everything should be handled.

For command-line alternatives there are the following:

 - For JavaScript, [JSHint][14] which may be installed with ```yarn add jshint```
 - For HTML, [html-lint][15] which may be installed with ```yarn add html-lint```
