# Usage examples

These directories illustrate how to use the Standards `uswds` [npm] package
with different tools:

1. Compiling CSS with [node-sass](node-sass/)
1. Bundling JavaScript with [browserify](browserify/) and [webpack](webpack/)
1. Automating CSS and JS generation with the [Grunt](grunt/) and [Gulp](gulp/)
   task runners

For each of these examples, you'll need to first install [Node.js] version 4 or
greater. Node comes with [npm], the Node Package Manager, a dependency manager
that uses the `package.json` in each directory to:

* determine what to download and install when you run `npm install`
* run repeatable tasks, or [scripts]
* publish your work to the npm registry
